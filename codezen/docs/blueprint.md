## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium-dark slate blue (#4A6572) for a professional and calming feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7), almost white, to provide a clean and distraction-free coding environment.
- Accent color: A muted teal (#69A297), slightly more saturated than the primary, for interactive elements and highlights, which stands out from the other colors.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Inter' is intended to promote readability of source code.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for the code editor, ensuring clear distinction of characters.
- Modern, minimalist icons to represent different languages, functions, and actions. Icons should be monochromatic.
- Subtle transitions and animations for interactive elements, such as opening/closing files and running code.
